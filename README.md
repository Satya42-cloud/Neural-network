## Classification Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with Hyperparameter Tuning on Alphabets Data

### Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for classifying data points from the "Alphabets_data.csv" dataset into various alphabet categories. The goal is to explore and refine ANN models through systematic hyperparameter tuning, aiming to enhance the model's performance and accuracy.

### Dataset
- Filename: Alphabets_data.csv
- Description: This dataset contains labeled samples representing different alphabets, suitable for a classification task. The data requires preprocessing to ensure optimal performance in the ANN model.
  
### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
#### Loading and Exploration:
- Loaded the dataset and summarized key features including the number of samples, features, and unique alphabet classes.
#### Preprocessing:
- Applied normalization techniques to scale feature values.
- Managed missing values through imputation or removal as needed to ensure data integrity.

### 2. Model Implementation
#### ANN Construction:
- Built a basic ANN model using a high-level neural network library (e.g., TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch).
- The model includes at least one hidden layer, with a choice of activation functions.
#### Data Splitting:
- Divided the dataset into training (e.g., 80%) and testing (e.g., 20%) sets.
#### Training and Prediction:
- Trained the ANN model on the training set and used it to make predictions on the test set.

### 3. Hyperparameter Tuning
#### Tuning Hyperparameters:
-Experimented with various hyperparameters, including:
1. Number of hidden layers
2. Number of neurons per hidden layer
3. Activation functions (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid)
4. Learning rate
#### Tuning Methodology:
- Used structured approaches like grid search or random search for hyperparameter optimization.
- Documented the tuning process and rationale for parameter choices.

### 4. Evaluation
#### Performance Metrics:
- Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
#### Comparison:
- Compared the performance of the default ANN model with the hyperparameter-tuned model.
- Discussed the impact of hyperparameter tuning on model accuracy and performance, highlighting improvements and insights gained.
